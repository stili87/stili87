## About Me
It started in, 2002 when I wrote my first HTML website in Microsoft Notepad. Ever since then I have always enjoyed writing code and working on applications. My life's journey did not lead me directly into software engineering but I am happy to finally arrive at this profession. I am a former attorney who has decided to make a career change into software engineering. I am incredibly excited to enter the world of tech and learn as much as I can about being a developer. I have a passion for working on new technologies and expanding my knowledge base as I begin this new expedition.

I attended a intensive 24-week coding boot camp at App Academy. This program has a 3% acceptance rate and over 1000 hours of software development training. Half of the time at the institution was spent pair programming with other students, solving assignments, and learning to work in a group setting according to Agile methodologies. After the conclusion of my instruction I have taken it upon my self to begin learning other languages like C, C++, and Java. 

As a software engineer, I have now developed three full stack applications from scratch using varying technologies. My most recent project , Clear-BnB, is a clone of Air-BnB that mirrors the functionality of the real site. Clear-BnB's back-end is built using Flask, Python and SQLalchemy, while the front end uses React and Redux for user interaction. My prior project, Better Reads, is a Good Reads clone using the same technologies but was built in a Agile environment with two other developers. 

I am currently proficient Javascript, Python, Express, Flask, SQL, PostgreSQL, SQLalchemy, HTML5, CCS3, and React / Redux. I have extensively used Git, Github, AWS S3. 

In addition to my use of technologies, I have been involved in multiple AGILE environments developing applications through pair programming. 

In my free time, I love spending time with my family, golfing with my friends, and getting a run in as often as I can.
