## About Me
My path to software engineering started in 2002, when I wrote my first website in Microsoft Notepad. Something about that first experience with code lead me to down the path to become a software developer. My journey did not lead me directly into this field, but I am ecstatic to finally arrive in this industry. I am a former attorney who has decided to make a career change into software engineering. I am incredibly excited to enter the world of tech and to have the opportunity to help build a large project that will improve society. As I have learned the ins and out of software development, I found that I adore learning and implementing new technologies to create and improve applications.

I attended a intense 24-week coding program at App Academy; a program that has a less than 3% acceptance rate and over 1000 hours of software development training. Every day we spent about 10 hours learning JavaScript, Python and a variety of other tools in order to become full-stack developers. Over half of each day was dedicated to pair programming small projects or coding challenges in order to apply what we had learned.

At the conclusion of the program, I developed three full stack applications from scratch using varying technologies. My most recent project , Clear-BnB, is a clone of Air-BnB that mirrors the functionality of the real site. Clear-BnB's back-end is built using Flask, Python and SQLalchemy, while the front end uses React, Redux, and some other libraries for a clean user experience. My prior project, Better Reads, is a Good Reads clone using the same technologies but was built in a Agile environment with two other developers. I served as Scrum master for this project.

I am currently proficient Javascript, Python, Express, Flask, SQL, PostgreSQL, SQLalchemy, HTML5, CCS3, and React / Redux. I have extensively used Git, Github, AWS S3. In addition to my use of technologies, I have been involved in multiple AGILE environments developing applications through pair programming.

If you are looking for a passionate software engineer, send me an email or give me call and I would be happy to speak with you.
